# Todo List Demo

This is a simple demo app to show how you can leverage River to easily convert an existing application to realtime.

Credits and thanks to [@missating](https://github.com/missating/nodejs-todo) for the inspiration for the Todo list app itself!

To use this with River, you neep to deploy the River infrastructure first. See the [deploy repo](https://github.com/river-live/deploy) for more information.

The deploy script will output all the information you need:

- Your server (`server.js`) needs to know the address of the API Gateway, as well as the key. The key is used as a simple means of authentication.
- Your frontend code (`app.js`) needs to know the address of the load balancer, as well as the secret. You need to generate a valid Jason Web Token using the provided secret. You can easily do so [here](https://jwt.io/).

To start the application, run:

- `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `npm start` to start the server

Navigate to localhost:3000 to see your wonderful app in action!
